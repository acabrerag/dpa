* ¿Qué es la Ciencia de datos?
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Estudio *fenomenológico* de *Sistemas Complejos Adaptativos*, con el propósito de
construir *productos de datos* que ayuden/soporten a la toma de decisiones y acciones
sobre el sistema.

* ¿Qué hace el científico de datos?

*Productos de datos*

* ¿Qué es un producto de datos?

La materialización de sistemas y procesos para la ingestión, almacenamiento,
tratamiento, transformación y entendimiento de datos para que puedan ser consumidos por agentes
que tienen como objetivo tomar acciones o decisiones sobre diversos sistemas. 

Los agentes en cuestión pueden ser humanos o algoritmos de aprendizaje de
máquina o agentes de inteligencia artificial. 


* Otra definición

- A *data product* is a system (or an agent) that continuously is sensing the
  environment, processing that information and providing actions or insights.

- It will form a /feedback loop/

* ¿Por qué necesitamos un producto de datos?

- The environment will adapt to our actions
- /Temporal drifting/
- In the best scenario, the organisation will adapt to those changes

* ¿Cómo lo implementamos?

- The *data product* is a transverse component in the architecture of the
  organisation, i.e. it touches several areas or divisions of the organisation,
  since it needs extract data from several sources.

- Besides this, the actions, taken or recommended, will impact several areas of
  the organisation.


* Disruption in the organisation

Esto obviamente causará *cambios* o *disrupciones* en como la organización
opera.

¿Cómo planeamos estas transformaciones?

* Enterprise Architecture

* Enterprise?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"[E]nterprise" is any collection of organizations that has a common
set of goals. For example, an enterprise could be a government agency, a whole
corporation, a division of a corporation, a single department, or a chain of
geographically distant organizations linked together by common ownership. 

*TOGAF 9.1 specification*
#+END_QUOTE

* Enterprise?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[I]n the context of "enterprise architecture" can be used to denote both an entire 
enterprise - encompassing all of its information and technology services, processes, 
and infrastructure-  and a specific domain within the enterprise.


*TOGAF 9.1 specification*
#+END_QUOTE


* Architecture?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their
relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing
its design and evolution.

*ISO/IEC 42010:2007*
#+END_QUOTE


* Enterprise Architecture

We could divide the Enterprise in the following layers:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Enterprise Architecture
is about the coherent design and modeling of all following layers:

- Business and Information Layer
- Application and Data Layer
- Infrastructure Layer

*Gerban Wierda, 2014*
#+END_QUOTE

* Why do we need it?

- To prevent IT chaos
  - We need structure in our landscape
- To make sure that Business-IT landscape fits the strategic business goals 
  - We want our structure to *follow* strategy
- To make sure the Business profits from opportunities enabled by IT 
  - We want our structure to *enable* strategy

/Chess and the art of Enterprise Architecture/ *Gerban Wierda*


* EA: It is about *choices*

- In change initiatives, *choices* are being made that are not in line with the
  company's *future*, *unknown* requirements
- In change initiatives, *choices* are being made in different parts of the
  organization that conflict with each other (/de facto/ not in line with
  *current*, *unmanaged* requirements)
- In change initiatives, *choices* are being made that are suboptimal, e.g bad for
  continuity, cost, timeliness, flexibility (/de facto/ not in line with
  *current*, *unmanaged* requirements)

/Chess and the art of Enterprise Architecture/ *Gerban Wierda*


* What does the Architect do?

The Enterprise Architect helps to define the following:

- *Current State Architecture* (or AS-IS). Descriptive Model of how the current
  landscape of business and IT is. It is used for reporting and analysis.
- *Future State Architecture* (or TO-BE). Is a /rough/ prescription on how the
  future landscape should be.
- *Change architectures*. These  are the descriptions of what the changes
  initiatives (like projects) will produce.


* The framework: TOGAF 9.0

- /The Open Group Architecture Framework/, [[https://www.opengroup.org/togaf/][TOGAF 9]] 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
TOGAF is an architecture framework. TOGAF provides the methods and tools for
assisting in the acceptance, production, use, and maintenance of an enterprise
architecture. It is based on an iterative process model supported by best
practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- The *Business Architecture* defines the business strategy, governance,
  organisation, and key business processes. 
  - What does the business do?
  - How does the business do these things?
- The *Data Architecture* describes the structure of an organisation's logical and
  physical data assets and data management resources. 
  - What are the key pieces of information that the business needs?
  - Which is the Enterprise Data Model?
- The *Application Architecture* provides a blueprint for the individual
  applications to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to
  the core business processes of the organisation. 
  - What are the key functions that our applications need to provide?
- The *Technology Architecture* describes the logical software and hardware
  capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business, data,
  and application services. This includes IT infrastructure, middleware,
  networks, communications, processing, standards, etc.

* EA's Challenges 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now, here is our very inconvenient truth: Enterprise Architecture as
a discipline has so far largely failed to produce the intended results

*Gerben Wierda, 2014*
#+END_QUOTE


* Example: Implementing DS in an enterprise

* Request

/Enterprise A/: *Do we have the conditions to embark in a Data Science project?*

* Example: Things to identify

- Why they want a Data Science initiative?
- Who are the main stakeholders? Which are their goals and concerns? Which are
  the main pains? Are those pains related to data? 
- Define precisely what the different stakeholders understand by "data science"?
- How aligned are the DS initiative and the actual and future goals of the
  enterprise?
- Which data do they have? How is that data? Where is that data? In which kind of
  storage? Is accessible?
- Do the enterprise have the processes to consume and produce data?
- How reliable is the infrastructure?
- Taken all this in account, Which are the gaps between the Current State Architecture
  and the Future State Architecture?

* Example: The Strategy

- Use a tailor-made ADM cycle: Only the phases A-E
- Identify the  stakeholders and their concerns 
- Apply questionnaires and interview the stakeholders
  - Identify the main business processes
- Collect (using templates) the information about Infrastructure, Applications
  and Data
- Analyse SWOT / TOWS
- Process the information to [[http://archimatetool.com][Archi]], an Archimate/EA tool
  - and then import that to a graph database.
- Establish the Data Maturity Level
- /Gap Analysis/

* Example: Business concerns

- Less manual work for integrating data
- Increase confidence in data
 

* Example: Business cases

- Deliver more complex data to the internal users in shorter response times
- Know their client better. Know the full span of the life cycle of the customer,
  so they can deliver more customised experience.
- Know better their operational force.


* Example: Data Maturity Level

- Data Governance
  - Do they know what data they have? How is the access to the data? Are there
    any docs? Are in place process about quality and anonymization? 
- Data Readiness
  - Do they have the data? How that data is stored? Is accessible? Which format
    they use? Are there silos? do they have historic data?
- CxO Engagement
  - Do the C-level believe in taking data-driven decisions? Are there any budget
    for this? A plan? A business case? 
- Organisational Engagement
  - The organisation is involved actively in the data? Do they use it for taking decisions?

/Adapted from DSaPP's Data Maturity Level Assessment/ *University of Chicago*

* Example: Data Maturity Level

- Financial Impact
  - What is the financial impact of those efforts (if any)?
- Data Science Readiness
  - Do they use some Data Science tools or methods ? Do they have the
    capabilities in the enterprise for start using it? Are there any
    organisational structure for execute the projects?
- Technological Readiness
  -  What tools do they use for analysis, processing and storage? Which is the
    technological level? How agile they are?
- Organisational Readiness
  - Is the organisation ready? Do they feel the pain of using data? Do they have
    the skills needed?

* Example: Gap Analysis


[[http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap27.html][TOGAF Gap Analysis]]


- Identify the Capabilities needed

- Identify the Gaps, impacts, risks, and efforts required for filling those gaps

  - Training, Infrastructure, Process, etc...

- Determine the building blocks

* How DS could help EA?


Many of the current processes in the enterprise have 
low visibility (/What is happening?/), unknown bottlenecks (/Why is this
happening?/), lack of quality checks (/This is so complex.../)

All this together doesn't facilitate communication between units of the
enterprise and makes growth and automation difficult.

Data science could help to improve efficiency and consistence, provide better
visibility internally between units and it will allow the business to make
data-driven decisions.

DS could do that providing new tools (Graph databases) and techniques (Network
analysis, Resilience, Prediction) for the analysis in the CSA.


* How EA could help DS

- Giving visibility about the impacts across the organisation

- Providing a semantic and an ontology

- Helping to create the data lake and to solve the record linkage problems


* Some glimpses in the future

- Intelligent Dataware houses or Data lakes

- Question and answering systems
  
- Multi-agents systems using the knowledge about the enterprise 

- The enterprise as an autonomous agent

* Architecture Principles

* Arquitectura de productos de datos

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Another conceivable path to superintelligence is through the gradual enhancement
of networks and organizations that link indidivual human minds with one another
and with various artifacts and bots... a  system's collective intelligence is
limited by the abilities of its members minds, the overheads in communicating
relevant information between them, and the various distortions and
inefficiencies that pervade human organizations ... Even partial solutions to
these problems could pay hefty dividends for collective intelligence
